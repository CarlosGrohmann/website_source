After the video on Hitler's issues with [peer-review](/2009-12-01-peer-review-process), this time we see him complaining about ArcGIS. Sounds so familiar... not sure why...  

Me? I'll keep using [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/), [QGIS](http://qgis.org/), [R](http://www.r-project.org/), and other [FOSS-GIS](http://www.osgeo.org/).
