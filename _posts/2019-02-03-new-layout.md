If you are reading this it means my website is... alive and well! And you can see that this website has changed a bit. It loads faster, the visual is different (cleaner, I hope) and it works on all screen sizes (well, maybe not on a [Nokia 3310](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310)).  

The reason for all these wonderful features? [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  

Jekyll is a Static Site Generator (SSG), meaning you create your content in simple text files using a markup language like [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and Jekyll converts it to a HTML/CSS [static web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). That simple. No need for databases or complex stuff.   

I found out about Jekyll when I decided to create the website for my Lab, the [SPAMLab](https://spamlab.github.io). That website is a [Github page](https://pages.github.com), hosted directly from our GitHub repository and build automatically every time you commit changes to the repository.  

I bought my domain with [namecheap.com](namecheap.com), and they have a nice [support page](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages) explaining how to serve your website through github pages. In this way, I can easily make the changes I want, commit only once (to github) and have my website both at [carlosgrohmann.com](https://carlosgrohmann.com) and at [carlosgrohmann.github.io](https://carlosgrohmann.github.io).
