Yes, that's right. I finally managed to get the SPAMLab website up and running. It's hosted on Github Pages: [SPAMLab.github.io](https://spamlab.github.io) I'll try to keep it updated with our research projects and activities. Stay tuned, and follow us on Twitter ([@spamlab.iee](https://twitter.com/spamlab.iee)) and Instagram ([@spamlab.iee](https://www.instagram.com/spamlab.iee)).
