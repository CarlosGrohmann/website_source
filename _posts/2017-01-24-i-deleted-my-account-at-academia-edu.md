I decided to delete my account at Academia.edu after reading Sarah Bondâ€™s article in [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/01/23/dear-scholars-delete-your-account-at-academia-edu/#7cefdaeb2ee0) and Ethan Gruber's [post](http://numismatics.org/pocketchange/open-access-academia-edu-and-why-im-all-in-on-zenodo-org/).   

I'm thinking about hosting the PDFs of my papers and other documents with [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [figshare](https://figshare.com) (I already have some docs [there](http://figshare.com/authors/Carlos_Grohmann/554217)). ![](/img/Screen-Shot-2017-01-24-at-22.53.55.png)
