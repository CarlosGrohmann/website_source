Topography is the manifestation of diverse endogenic and exogenic geologic processes that are dynamic and thus continually shape our planet. Examples being crustal deformation due to earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes, river flooding, glaciers and ice sheets melting.  

Geological processes monitoring requires regularly repeated acquisition of accurate, high-resolution topographic information. The rapid growth in the availability of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, TerraSAR-X Satellite Mission, ICESat and CryoSat missions, photogrammetric-derived DEMs from orbital imagery (ALOS, ASTER, SPOT) and laser altimetry/scanning (LiDAR), provided a way to look at our planet with an unprecedented detail, often allowing the recognition of previously unknown features and the establishment of their spatial relationships.  

Digital Terrain Analysis (DTA) provides the framework for terrain quantification, segmentation and classification, aiming both at processes recognition and simulation in attempt to extrapolate terrain knowledge and provide insight views either to the past or to the future.  

Geological science is benefited by the advances in DTA, examples being natural hazard/risk assessment, geomorphological process evaluation, morphotectonic interpretation, and geophysical data processing.  

This special issue of IJGIS is seeking original unpublished papers that illustrate the diversity of geological applications of Digital Terrain Analysis. Suggested topics include (but are not limited to): 

 - Geological features segmentation from high resolution DEMs,  

 - Geological processes recognition and monitoring from multi-temporal DEMs,  

 - DTA techniques in geophysical data processing,  

 - DTA applications in mineral exploration, oil and gas,  

etc.

Submission:  


All manuscripts should be submitted using the journal’s online Manuscript Central facility (<http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ijgis>). Authors must select “Special Issue” while they reach the “Article Type” step in the submission process, and identify the “Geological Applications of Digital Terrain Analysis” special issue in their cover letter. First-time users must register themselves as Author.
