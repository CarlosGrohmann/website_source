Now this is frakking awesome! Two cool animations that you can interact to see things all scales, from human to atom, from the atom to the whole universe!  

The first one is from the University of Utah, and let you see things from the size of a [coffee beam to a carbon atom](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/scale/):  

  

The second one, by someone known as Fotoshop, shows everything. From [quantum foam to galaxies](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/525347).  



Really, really cool.
