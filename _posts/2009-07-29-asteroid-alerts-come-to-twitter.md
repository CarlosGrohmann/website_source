NASA has created another Twitter account: [@AsteroidWatch](http://twitter.com/asteroidwatch) will alert you any time a space rock gets within a few lunar distances from Earth.   

Some other tweets from NASA include [@NASA](http://twitter.com/nasa), [@LRO_NASA](http://twitter.com/lro_NASA), [@MarsPhoenix](http://www.twitter.com/MarsPhoenix/), and feeds for other robots, probes and astronauts.  

Will you follow this one?
