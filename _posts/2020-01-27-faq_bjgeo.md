The [Brazilian Journal of Geology](http://www.scielo.br/bjgeo/) is the official publication of the [Brazilian Geological Society](http://www.sbgeo.org.br/). As the Deputy Editor, I receive emails with common questions about the journal. So I decided to crate a page with some useful information for potential authors.
