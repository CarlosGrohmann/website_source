Good news!  
  
It was just announced that NASA/METI released today the 30m global (83degreesNS, about 22600 scenes) ASTER GDEM based on 1,264,118 single ASTER dems from 1.4 million scenes  in total. (95% vertical ci: 20 meters, 95% horizontal ci: 30 meters).  

According to Hannes Reuter, "the link to the evaluation report will be probably be published today/the coming days. as i/we had the possibility to evaluate 5 tiles beforehand - from our analysis i/we can tell that you will run into some of the following: step anomalies across mosaicing edges, mole runs, sinks (we observed some down to 180m below the surrounding), artifical mountains (up to 200m), noise, non existing water mask, in case only a couple of images.

see <http://www.gdem.aster.ersdac.or.jp/>  or LP DAAC [https://wist.echo.nasa.gov/~wist/api/imswelcome/](https://wist.echo.nasa.gov/%7Ewist/api/imswelcome/)  

Since a large traffic is expected in the first days, restrictions of 100 tiles apply and only 16 connections at the same time are allowed.
