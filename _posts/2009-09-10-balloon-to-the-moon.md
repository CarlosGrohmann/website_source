The non-profit [Aeronautics and Cosmonautics Romanian Association](http://www.arcaspace.ro/) (ARCA)is about to test a new way to send a probe to the Moon: using a balloon.  

Their first prototype should be ready to launch in October. Watch a cool video below and go to Nature's Great Beyond blog to read the full story [here](http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/09/romania_to_the_moon_by_balloon.html).
