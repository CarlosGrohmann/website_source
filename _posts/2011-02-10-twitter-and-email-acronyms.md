This is just FYI, but if you're lost in the middle of all the acronyms going around, this might be useful. maybe you find yourself LOL with the list, and some are NSFW. In the end, it might be TMI anyway. The list was compiled from [this post](http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-abbreviations-2010-8#ixzz1DZ1LZMUL) and its comments.  

#### Technical Twitter abbreviations:  

MT = Modified tweet. This means the tweet you're looking at is a paraphrase of a tweet originally written by someone else.  

RT = Retweet. The tweet you're looking at was forwarded to you by another user.  

DM = Direct message. A direct-message is a message only you and the person who sent it can read. IMPORTANT: To DM someone all you need to type is D username message.  

PRT = Partial retweet. The tweet you're looking at is the truncated version of someone else's tweet.  

HT = Hat tip. This is a way of attributing a link to another Twitter user.  

CC = Carbon-copy. Works the same way as email.
