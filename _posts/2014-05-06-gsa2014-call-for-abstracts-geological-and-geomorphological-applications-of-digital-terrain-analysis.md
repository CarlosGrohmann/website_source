Topical Session T128.   
Geological and Geomorphological Applications of Digital Terrain Analysis  
Carlos Henrique Grohmann, Christopher J. Crosby, Edwin Nissen   

Abstracts submission deadline: 29 July   

Monitoring and quantification of rates of geomorphic processes requires repeated acquisition of accurate, high resolution topographic information. The rapid growth in the availability of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, TerraSARX Satellite Mission, ICESat and CryoSat missions, photogrammetric derived DEMs from orbital imagery (ALOS, ASTER, SPOT) or from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and laser altimetry/scanning (LiDAR), provide a way to look at the topography of our planet in unprecedented detail, often allowing the recognition of previously unknown features and the establishment of their spatial relationships. Digital Terrain Analysis (DTA) provides the framework for terrain quantification classification and monitoring, aiming at the recognition and simulation of geomorphic processes. Advances in DTA have impacted areas such as hazard and risk assessment, geomorphologic process evaluation, morphotectonic interpretation, and geophysical data processing. A first instalment of this session took place during the 2013 GSA meeting. It was well attended and involved a wide spectrum of terrain analysis applications and data collection techniques, such as ground based/airborne LiDAR, SRTM, ASTER GDEM and Structure from Motion. We expect this session to build on last year’s momentum and to extend and expand DTA discussions and networking between scientists in this rapidly growing field. This session will provide an excellent opportunity to present and discuss recent advances in methods, algorithms, and applications of DTA to geology and geomorphology.
