Really nice. Astronomers at Princeton compile in one single plot all that we can see in the universe. Everything. The plot is in logarithm scale, of course. Click on the image to see a full-sized version. And while you are at it, go to [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/482/) and check what they did, way before the Princeton team.

The tip goes, as usual to [BadAstronomy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/11/from-here-to-infinity-logarithmically/)
