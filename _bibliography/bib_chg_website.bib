  abstract  = {The 6 th Latin American Congress of Sedimentology (VI LACS) was held at the Universidade de São Paulo main campus, in the city of São Paulo, 14-17 July 2013. This is the main scientific event focused on the Latin American community of sedimentologists and stratigraphers, promoted under the seal of IAS, the International Association of Sedimentologists, since 1997. The VI LACS had 380 registrations: 251 from Brazil and 129 from 17 other countries, mainly of South America. There were 121 presented works, which integrated the abstracts book. After the event, the authors were invited to submit a full paper version of theirs abstracts to the Annals of the Congress , which is being published now as this special supplement of the Brazilian Journal of Geology , with financial support from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (Grant 452723/2013-2).},

  abstract  = {This work presents the development of a three-dimensional (3D) model of an outcrop of the Corumbataí Formation (Permian, Paraná Basin, Brazil) using Structure from Motion - Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) technique in order to provide a structural analysis of clastic dikes cutting through siltstone layers. While traditional photogrammetry requires the user to input a series of parameters related to the camera orientation and its characteristics (such as focal distance), in SfM-MVS the scene geometry, camera position and orientations are automatically determined by a bundle adjustment, an iterative procedure based on a set of overlapping images. It is considered a low-cost technique in terms of hardware and software, also being able to provide point density and accuracy on par to the ones obtained withTerrestrial Laser Scanning. The results acquired on this research have good agreement with previous works, yielding a NNW main orientation for the dikes measured in the field and on the 3D model. The development of this work showed that SfM-MVS use and practice on geosciences still needs more studies on the optimization of the involved parameters (such as camera orientation, image overlap and angle of illumination), which, when accomplished, will result in less processing time and more accurate models.},

In addition to the welcome diversification in journal choices for authors looking for open access venues, there are many positive aspects of Science Advances: its broad STEM scope, its interest in cross-disciplinary research, and the offering of fee waivers. While we welcome the commitment of the Association to open access, we are also deeply concerned with the specific approach. Herein, we outline a number of suggestions that are in line with both the current direction that scholarly publishing is taking and the needs expressed by the open access community, which this journal aims to serve.},

  abstract  = {We describe the occurrence of non-marine bivalves in exposures of the Middle Permian (Capitanian) Brenton Loch Formation on the southern shore of Choiseul Sound, East Falklands. The bivalves are associated with ichnofossils and were collected from a bed in the upper part of the formation, within a 25 cm thick interval of dark siltstones and mudstones with planar lamination, overlain by massive sandstones. The shells are articulated, with the valves either splayed open or closed. At the top of the succession, mudstone beds nearly 1.5 m above the bivalve-bearing layers yielded well-preserved Glossopteris sp. cf. G. communis leaf fossils. The closed articulated condition of some shells indicates preservation under high sedimentation rates with low residence time of bioclasts at the sediment/water interface. However, the presence of specimens with splayed shells is usually correlated to the slow decay of the shell ligament in oxygen-deficient bottom waters. The presence of complete carbonized leaves of Glossopteris associated with the bivalve-bearing levels also suggests a possibly dysoxic-anoxic bottom environment. Overall, our data suggest that the bivalves were preserved by abrupt burial, possibly by distal sediment flows into a Brenton Loch lake, and may represent autochthonous to parautochthonous fossil accumulations. The shells resemble those of anthracosiids and are herein assigned to Palaeanodonta sp. aff. P. dubia, a species also found in the Permian succession of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Our results confirm that (a) the true distributions in space and time of all Permian non-marine (freshwater) bivalves are not yet well known, and (b) there is no evidence for marine conditions in the upper part of the Brenton Loch Formation.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we analyze how variation in cell size influences the volume calculated from digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey in two coastal Late Holocene dune fields in southern Brazil. Cell size varied from 1 to 100m. RMSE (root mean square error) of the resampled DTMs from the original LiDAR (with 0.5m resolution) increases linearly with cell size, while R2 (coefficient of determination) decreases following a second-order trend. The volume does not show simple linear or exponential behavior, but fluctuates with positive and negative deviations from the original DTM. This can be explained by a random factor in the position of the cell with regard to landforms and a relationship between cell and landform size, wherein a small change in cell size can lead to an under- or overestimation of volume. The ASTER GDEM (global digital elevation model) and X-SAR SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 1″ digital elevation models (DEMs) were not considered viable volume sources due to large deviations from the reference data, either as a consequence of noise in the SRTM X-SAR data or lack of bias elevation correction to a common reference base in the GDEM processing chain. Volumes from a 3-arcsec SIR-C SRTM deviated around ±5% from the reference data and are considered suitable input for numerical simulations of Quaternary dune field evolution models because these values should be within the expected range of sediment volume changes over hundreds to millions of years.},

  abstract  = {Base-level maps (or "isobase maps", as originally defined by Filosofov, 1960), express a relationship between valley order and topography. The base-level map can be seen as a "simplified" version of the original topographic surface, from which the "noise" of the low-order stream erosion was removed. This method is able to identify areas with possible tectonic influence even within lithologically uniform domains. Base-level maps have been recently applied in semi-detail scale (e.g., 1:50 000 or larger) morphotectonic analysis. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the method's applicability in regional-scale analysis (e.g., 1:250 000 or smaller). A test area was selected in northern Brazil, at the lower course of the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers. The drainage network extracted from SRTM30_PLUS DEMs with spatial resolution of approximately 900 m was visually compared with available topographic maps and considered to be compatible with a 1:1,000 000 scale. Regarding the interpretation of regional-scale morphostructures, the map constructed with 2nd and 3rd-order valleys was considered to present the best results. Some of the interpreted base-level anomalies correspond to important shear zones and geological contacts present in the 1:5 000 000 Geological Map of South America. Others have no correspondence with mapped Precambrian structures and are considered to represent younger, probably neotectonic, features. A strong E-W orientation of the base-level lines over the inflexion of the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers, suggest a major drainage capture. A N-S topographic swath profile over the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers reveals a topographic pattern which, allied with seismic data showing a roughly N-S direction of extension in the area, lead us to interpret this lineament as an E-W, southward-dipping normal fault. There is also a good visual correspondence between the base-level lineaments and geophysical anomalies. A NW-SE lineament in the southeast of the study area partially corresponds to the northern border of the Mosquito lava field, of Jurassic age, and a NW-SE lineament traced in the northeastern sector of the study area can be interpreted as the Picos-Santa Inês lineament, identifiable in geophysical maps but with little expression in hypsometric or topographic maps.},

  abstract  = {The Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) Itapucumí Group in northern Paraguay is composed of carbonate and siliciclastic rocks, including ooid grainstones, marls, shales and sandstones, containing Cloudina fossils in the eastern region. It is almost undeformed over the Rio Apa Cratonic Block but shows a strong deformational pattern at its western edge. A detailed structural analysis of the Itapucumí Group was conducted in the Vallemí Mine, along with a regional survey in other outcrops downstream in the Paraguay River and in the San Alfredo, Cerro Paiva and Sargento José E. López regions. In the main Vallemí quarry, the structural style is characterized by an axial-plane slaty cleavage in open to isoclinal folds, sometimes overturned, associated with N–S trending thrust faults and shear zones of E-vergence and with a low-grade chlorite zone metamorphism. The structural data presented here are compatible with the hypothesis of a newly recognized mobile belt on the western side of the Rio Apa Cratonic Block, with opposite vergence to that of the Paraguay Mobile Belt in Brazil. Both belts are related to the Late Brasiliano/Pan-African tectonic cycle with a Lower Cambrian deformation and metamorphism age. The deformation could be due to the late collision of the Amazonian Craton with the remainder of Western Gondwana or to the western active plate boundary related to the Pampean Belt. The structural and lithologic differences between the western Itapucumí Group in the Vallemí and Paraguay River region and the eastern region, near San Alfredo and Cerro Paiva, suggest that this group could be divided into two lithostratigraphic units, but more stratigraphic and geochronological analyses are required to confirm this possibility.},

  abstract    = {Surface roughness is an important geomorphological variable which has been used in the Earth and planetary sciences to infer material properties, current/past processes, and the time elapsed since formation. No single definition exists; however, within the context of geomorphometry, we use surface roughness as an expression of the variability of a topographic surface at a given scale, where the scale of analysis is determined by the size of the landforms or geomorphic features of interest. Six techniques for the calculation of surface roughness were selected for an assessment of the parameter's behavior at different spatial scales and data-set resolutions. Area ratio operated independently of scale, providing consistent results across spatial resolutions. Vector dispersion produced results with increasing roughness and homogenization of terrain at coarser resolutions and larger window sizes. Standard deviation of residual topography highlighted local features and did not detect regional relief. Standard deviation of elevation correctly identified breaks of slope and was good at detecting regional relief. Standard deviation of slope (SDslope) also correctly identified smooth sloping areas and breaks of slope, providing the best results for geomorphological analysis. Standard deviation of profile curvature identified the breaks of slope, although not as strongly as SDslope, and it is sensitive to noise and spurious data. In general, SDslope offered good performance at a variety of scales, while the simplicity of calculation is perhaps its single greatest benefit.},

  abstract  = {A first assessment of the TanDEM-X DEMs over Brazilian territory is presented through a comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 DEMs in seven study areas with distinct geomorphological contexts, vegetation coverage, and land use. Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12 m data to a 30 m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30 m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.},

  abstract  = {In the Amazonian lowlands, the shift from a large wetland dominated by flooded forests (Várzea) to the modern incised valleys bounded by extensive areas of non-flooded forests (Terra Firme) is considered a key driver of the Amazonian mega-biodiversity. Dating the sedimentary beds covered by Terra Firme forest is crucial to constrain the timing of such landscape change. Here we determined the formation ages of widespread regions of Terra Firme substrates in central Amazonian lowlands combining optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, magnetostratigraphy and palinostratigraphy. Our data suggest a very dynamic fluvial system leading to a recent expansion of Terra Firme forests and retraction of Várzea forests during the late Pleistocene. The shift from an extensively flooded to non-flooded surface resulted from river incision around 45-35 ka, which potentially influenced the distribution of taxa by expanding available habitat, creating new barriers to dispersal, or changing the permeability of previous barriers. Transitions between flooded and non-flooded landscapes may have driven diversification and caused changes to species distributions, contributing to the high species diversity and biogeographic patterns currently found in the region. The late Quaternary evolution of Terra Firme substrates reveals that physical landscape changes play a major role in shaping biotic habitats even in the 104–105 years time-scales.},

  abstract  = {The origin of modern disjunct plant distributions in the Brazilian Highlands with strong floristic affinities to distant montane rainforests of isolated mountaintops in the northeast and northern Amazonia and the Guyana Shield remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that these unexplained biogeographical patterns reflect former ecosystem rearrangements sustained by widespread plant migrations possibly due to climatic patterns that are very dissimilar from present-day conditions. To address this issue, we mapped the presence of the montane arboreal taxa Araucaria, Podocarpus, Drimys, Hedyosmum, Ilex, Myrsine, Symplocos, and Weinmannia, and cool-adapted plants in the families Myrtaceae, Ericaceae, and Arecaceae (palms) in 29 palynological records during Heinrich Stadial 1 Event, encompassing a latitudinal range of 30°S to 0°S. In addition, Principal Component Analysis and Species Distribution Modelling were used to represent past and modern habitat suitability for Podocarpus and Araucaria. The data reveals two long-distance patterns of plant migration connecting south/southeast to northeastern Brazil and Amazonia with a third short route extending from one of them. Their paleofloristic compositions suggest a climatic scenario of abundant rainfall and relative lower continental surface temperatures, possibly intensified by the effects of polar air incursions forming cold fronts into the Brazilian Highlands. Although these taxa are sensitive to changes in temperature, the combined pollen and speleothems proxy data indicate that this montane rainforest expansion during Heinrich Stadial 1 Event was triggered mainly by a less seasonal rainfall regime from the subtropics to the equatorial region.},

  abstract   = {This work presents a 1:10,000 geomorphological mapping of an area in southeastern Brazil, based on morphometric analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), while classical methods focus on photo interpretation. Data derived from the DEM include elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, vertical and horizontal curvatures, amplitude, elongation and wavelength of landforms. These parameters were used along with slope shape and drainage patterns to classify the landforms according to the Land Systems method, in which portions of the landscape that presents similar terrains attributes are grouped from regional (low detail) to local (high detail) scales, respectively, Land Systems, Land Units and Land Elements. The São Paulo State geomorphological map at 1:1,000,000 scale is considered the best reference source, and was compared with the results obtained in this project. Two Land Systems, four Land Units and twelve Land Elements were identified in the study area. In this area, karst terrains are common and easily identified due their characteristics drainage patterns, amplitude and slope gradient. Karst terrain boundaries defined in this study do overlap with those defined in the state map, however the morphometric analysis allowed a better description of the terrain attributes used to define them. The terrain attributes derived automatically from the DEM enabled an accurate geomorphological classification of the study area. The methodology presented in this paper is considered effective for mapping landforms at a detailed scale and can be employed in regional scale mapping using coarser resolution DEMs.},

  abstract  = {Recent concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have a clear effect on the energy sector, directly affecting the use of fossil fuels. Companies and countries that depend on these sources of energy (so-called not clean) take actions to search for palliative solutions. The production of atlases of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the collaborative actions that seeks to systematize and organize several aspects involving the use of CCS technologies. This paper focuses on an analytical overview of approaches addressed by five different CCS atlases published by Brazil, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Norway, and South Africa. The five atlases are available for public access; an analytical overview could substantiate the academic and technical decisions related to the future publication of a new atlas for any country and suggests the inclusion of new topics such as social and environmental issues.},

  abstract  = {We present a new 52 m composite record (COL17c) composed of five sedimentary sequences retrieved from the Colônia basin (Southeastern Brazil). The COL17c record is composed of two main sub-units deposited under different regimes: a peatland above ~14 m and lacustrine sediments below. Sedimentary description and core scanning (MSCL and XRF) are first used to align individual cores in order to produce a nearly continuous composite record. We then established an original chronological framework based on radiocarbon, paleomagnetic, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence at elevated temperature (pIRIR290°C) and authigenic 10Be/9Be dating. We describe the protocols used for each technique and discuss the positive and negative results, as well as their implications for proxy interpretation. In spite of negative results of some techniques, mainly due to the absence of adequate sample material, the multi-proxy approach used is essential to maximize the chances of obtaining a satisfactory age model for this unique continental sedimentary sequence. All valid chronological proxies, comprising three AMS 14C ages, one pIRIR290°C age, two paleomagnetic constraints and eight authigenic 10Be/9Be datum, are integrated within a Bayesian age-depth modeling to produce a 1.5 ± 0.1 Ma chronology for the whole COL17c sequence. This age model represents the first long-term chronological estimate of sediments deposition in the Colônia basin. The record allows to refine the age of the Colônia basin formation between 5.3 and 11.2 Ma, much older than previously estimated from short sedimentary cores.},

  abstract  = {Sand dunes are commonly regarded as a challenge to traditional photogrammetry due their homogeneous texture and spectral response. In this work we present an evaluation of Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to obtain high-resolution elevation data of coastal sand dunes based on images acquired by Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of a dunefield in Southern Brazil was generated from 810 photos captured by an RPA at 100 m above the takeoff point in February 2019. Image matching was successful in all areas of the survey due the presence of superficial features (footprints and sandboard tracks) and visibility of the sedimentary stratification, highlighted by heavy minerals. Altimetric accuracy of the SfM-MVS DEM was validated by comparison with Terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) data collected during the same fieldwork campaign of the RPA flights. The SfM-MVS DEM was then compared to an Airborne LiDAR (ALS) DEM from October 2010. While the SfM-MVS and TLS DEMs are very similar, without any major difference in elevation or in the reconstruction of topographic features, the SfM-MVS DEM presents a small scale surface roughness not visible in the TLS DEM. The Feature Preserving DEM Smoothing (FPD) algorithm was applied to the SfM-MVS DEM with good results in terms of surface smoothing, but without any significant changes in descriptive statistics and error metrics, with an RMSE of 0.08 m and MAE of 0.06 m for both the original and the FPD-filtered DEM. Displacement of dune crest lines from the ALS and SfM-MVS DEMs resulted in a migration rate of ≈5 m/year between 2010 and 2019, in good agreement with rates derived from satellite images and historical aerial photographs of the same area. Sand volume change in the same period showed a decrease of only 0.2%, which can be related to the installation of sand fences to promote dune stabilization and sand removal from the front of the dune field to keep a road open to vehicles. ALS can cover large areas in little time but its high cost still remains a barrier to wider usage, especially by researchers in developing countries. TLS has an intermediate cost but demands more fieldwork and more processing time. In our case we needed three days for the TLS survey and around three weeks to produce a DEM of ≈80 400m2. On the other hand, we were able to cover ≈740 900m2 with six flight missions in under three hours, with ≈13 h processing time in a medium-range workstation. This makes SfM-MVS a low-cost solution with fast and reliable results for 3D modelling and continuous monitoring of coastal dunes.},

Concentrations ranged from 417 to 8178 particles/kg of dried sediment (microplastics: 0.063–5 mm), and from 0 to 5725 particles/kg of dried sediment (microplastics: 0.063–1 mm). The highest microplastics concentrations were observed in samples from shallow water (water depth of 5–7 m) sites with lower water velocity of the Negro river surrounding Manaus, and the lowest concentration in farthest sample collected in deeper zone (water depth of 34 m) of the Amazon river around 110 km downstream Manaus. The variation of microplastics concentrations within the studied area can be related to hydraulic characteristics defining the erosive-depositional behavior of the sampling sites and their proximity to Manaus. Our results represent the first report to show the ubiquitous presence and widespread distribution of microplastics in sediments from the lower Solimões, lower Negro and upper Amazon rivers.

In this context, the Brazilian government committed itself to restore 12 million hectares of forests by 2030. RDA monitoring customarily depends on extensive fieldwork to collect data on all individuals planted. As remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) can reduce costs and time of fieldwork activities, studying this technology is therefore timely given. A crucial metric for RDA is the number of trees established in the area. Methods using RPAs on automatic tree counting showed good accuracy using algorithms based on the canopy height model (CHM), which is the difference between a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM). However, obtaining a DTM demands an extra computational processing step and may require field control points or manually delimiting objects on the surface. The study presented here proposes and evaluates a semi-automated methodology for counting trees directly on DSM in RDAs in the Amazon using RPA coupled with a red–green–blue standard photographic sensor. The DSM method obtained good overall accuracy and F-score indexes, superior to the CHM method for all study areas even when overall accuracy was low for both methods.},
