  abstract  = {The 6 th Latin American Congress of Sedimentology (VI LACS) was held at the Universidade de São Paulo main campus, in the city of São Paulo, 14-17 July 2013. This is the main scientific event focused on the Latin American community of sedimentologists and stratigraphers, promoted under the seal of IAS, the International Association of Sedimentologists, since 1997. The VI LACS had 380 registrations: 251 from Brazil and 129 from 17 other countries, mainly of South America. There were 121 presented works, which integrated the abstracts book. After the event, the authors were invited to submit a full paper version of theirs abstracts to the Annals of the Congress , which is being published now as this special supplement of the Brazilian Journal of Geology , with financial support from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (Grant 452723/2013-2).},

  abstract  = {This work presents the development of a three-dimensional (3D) model of an outcrop of the Corumbataí Formation (Permian, Paraná Basin, Brazil) using Structure from Motion - Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) technique in order to provide a structural analysis of clastic dikes cutting through siltstone layers. While traditional photogrammetry requires the user to input a series of parameters related to the camera orientation and its characteristics (such as focal distance), in SfM-MVS the scene geometry, camera position and orientations are automatically determined by a bundle adjustment, an iterative procedure based on a set of overlapping images. It is considered a low-cost technique in terms of hardware and software, also being able to provide point density and accuracy on par to the ones obtained withTerrestrial Laser Scanning. The results acquired on this research have good agreement with previous works, yielding a NNW main orientation for the dikes measured in the field and on the 3D model. The development of this work showed that SfM-MVS use and practice on geosciences still needs more studies on the optimization of the involved parameters (such as camera orientation, image overlap and angle of illumination), which, when accomplished, will result in less processing time and more accurate models.},

  abstract             = {The shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), was flow on the space shuttle Endeavour in February 2000, with the objective of acquiring a digital elevation model of all land between 60° north latitude and 56° south latitude, using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. The SRTM data are distributed at horizontal resolution of 1 arc‐second (∼30 m) for areas within the USA and at 3 arc‐second (∼90 m) resolution for the rest of the world. A resolution of 90 m can be considered suitable for the small or medium‐scale analysis, but it is too coarse for more detailed purposes. One alternative is to interpolate the SRTM data at a finer resolution; it will not increase the level of detail of the original digital elevation model (DEM), but it will lead to a surface where there is the coherence of angular properties (i.e. slope, aspect) between neighbouring pixels, which is an important characteristic when dealing with terrain analysis. This work intents to show how the proper adjustment of variogram and kriging parameters, namely the nugget effect and the maximum distance within which values are used in interpolation, can be set to achieve quality results on resampling SRTM data from 3” to 1”. We present for a test area in western USA, which includes different adjustment schemes (changes in nugget effect value and in the interpolation radius) and comparisons with the original 1” model of the area, with the national elevation dataset (NED) DEMs, and with other interpolation methods (splines and inverse distance weighted (IDW)). The basic concepts for using kriging to resample terrain data are: (i) working only with the immediate neighbourhood of the predicted point, due to the high spatial correlation of the topographic surface and omnidirectional behaviour of variogram in short distances; (ii) adding a very small random variation to the coordinates of the points prior to interpolation, to avoid punctual artifacts generated by predicted points with the same location than original data points and; (iii) using a small value of nugget effect, to avoid smoothing that can obliterate terrain features. Drainages derived from the surfaces interpolated by kriging and by splines have a good agreement with streams derived from the 1” NED, with correct identification of watersheds, even though a few differences occur in the positions of some rivers in flat areas. Although the 1” surfaces resampled by kriging and splines are very similar, we consider the results produced by kriging as superior, since the spline‐interpolated surface still presented some noise and linear artifacts, which were removed by kriging.},

A methodology to integrate GIS and statistics in morphometric analysis is presented for the most usual morphometric parameters—hypsometry, slope, aspect, swath profiles, lineaments and drainage density, surface roughness, isobase and hydraulic gradient. The GIS used was the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS-GIS), an open-source project that offers an integrated environment for raster and vector analysis, image processing and maps/graphics creation. Statistical analysis of parameters can be carried out on R, a system for statistical computation and graphics, through an interface with GRASS that allows raster maps and points files to be treated as variables for analysis. The basic element for deriving morphometric maps is the digital elevation model (DEM). It can be interpolated from scattered points or contours, either in raster or vector format; it is also possible to use DEMs from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission, with 30m of ground resolution for the USA and 90m for other countries. Proposed methodology can be adapted according to necessities and available tools. The use of free and open-source tools guarantees access to everyone, and its increasing popularization opens new development perspectives in this research field.},

Morphometric maps were evaluated in GRASS-GIS and statistics were made on R statistical language, using the spatial package. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was made to test the significance of each surface and the significance of increasing polynomial degree. The best results were achieved with sixth-order surface for isobase and second-order surface for hydraulic gradient. Shape and orientation of residual maps contours for selected trends were compared with structures inferred from several morphometric maps, and a good correlation is present.},

Morphometric indices evaluated showed the correlation of landscape within the massif with NE–SW and NW–SE structures, as well as landforms related with recent tectonic influence. DEM-derived drainage presented satisfactory results when compared to a 1:50,000 topographic map. SRTM 03″ proved to be a good resource for geomorphological analysis, up to the semi-detail scale.},

The Aiuruoca-Andrelândia nappe is one of the nappes of this system. The hind portion of the Aiuruoca-Andrelândia nappe, south of Caxambu and Aiuruoca (MG), consists of a structural-metamorphic domain transported toward the E-NE. There is a metamorphic transition, from the kyanite zone to kyanite and sillimanite coexistence, until the sillimanite zone. Metapelitic rocks preserve high-pressure parageneses (Rt–Ky–Grt–Ms–Bt–Pl–Qtz) and contain retrograde eclogitic rocks. Sil–Pl–Qtz coronitic intergrowths around garnets are common decompressive textures. Kyanite schists register the Pmax of 11kbar at 660 °C and define a decompressive path until 6–7.5kbar at 650 °C. These P–T conditions represent the equilibrium in S2 schistosity (amphibolite facies) and the beginning of the cooling path in the Ky–Sil transition. The decompressive path suggests an extrusional process, immediately after burying at about 60 km. Exhumation controlled by convergent events, related to the São Francisco Plate subduction and tectonic erosion, took these units, isothermally, to higher levels (20–33 km). Later, the metamorphic path shifted toward near-isobaric cooling.},

  abstract  = {The Xingu River is a large clearwater river in eastern Amazonia and its downstream sector, known as the Volta Grande do Xingu ("Xingu Great Bend"), is a unique fluvial landscape that plays an important role in the biodiversity, biogeochemistry and prehistoric and historic peopling of Amazonia. The sedimentary dynamics of the Xingu River in the Volta Grande and its downstream sector will be shifted in the next few years due to the construction of dams associated with the Belo Monte hydropower project. Impacts on river biodiversity and carbon cycling are anticipated, especially due to likely changes in sedimentation and riverbed characteristics. This research project aims to define the geological and climate factors responsible for the development of the Volta Grande landscape and to track its environmental changes during the Holocene, using the modern system as a reference. In this context, sediment cores, riverbed rock and sediment samples and greenhouse gas (GHG) samples were collected in the Volta Grande do Xingu and adjacent upstream and downstream sectors. The reconstruction of past conditions in the Volta Grande is necessary for forecasting future scenarios and defining biodiversity conservation strategies under the operation of Belo Monte dams. This paper describes the scientific questions of the project and the sampling surveys performed by an international team of Earth scientists and biologists during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Preliminary results are presented and a future workshop is planned to integrate results, present data to the scientific community and discuss possibilities for deeper drilling in the Xingu ria to extend the sedimentary record of the Volta Grande do Xingu.},

Os mapas foram elaborados pela metodologia de álgebra desenvolvida em ambiente SIG, através da definição de fatores desencadeantes e seus respectivos pesos conforme a influência na deflagração dos eventos estudados. Para a análise da vulnerabilidade à ocorrência de vazamentos da rede de abastecimento de água foram utilizados na álgebra de mapas os fatores de idade, pressão da rede e número de manutenções recorrentes. Os maiores valores ocorreram nas redes que já haviam sofrido manutenções recorrentes, porém ao lançarmos no mapa os acidentes geológicos que foram levantados, estes estiveram associados a áreas de alta ou média vulnerabilidades. Portanto, pode-se concluir que os demais fatores analisados (idade e pressão) tiveram maior influência na deflagração desses eventos. Assim é possível concluir que a metodologia aplicada mostrou-se satisfatória aos objetivos propostos. Salienta-se que a metodologia pode ser integralmente desenvolvida em programas livres e gratuitos de SIG, facilitando desta maneira o acesso por órgãos públicos.},

  abstract  = {Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) are datasets of vital importance for regional-scale analysis in areas such as geomorphology, [paleo]climatology, oceanography and biodiversity. In this work I present a comparative assessment of the datasets ETOPO1 (1’ resolution), GTOPO30, GLOBE, SRTM30 PLUS, GMTED2010 and ACE2 (30”) against the altitude of the world’s ultra prominent peaks. GDEMs’ elevations show an expected tendency of underestimating the peak’s altitude, but differences reach 3,500 m. None of the GDEMs captures the full range of elevation on Earth and they do not represent well the altitude of the most prominent peaks. Some of these problems could be addressed with the release of NASADEM, but the smoothing effect caused by moving-window resampling can only be tackled by using new techniques, such as scale-adaptative kernels and curvature-based terrain generalisation.},

  abstract  = {The acquisition of geological attitudes on rock cuts using traditional field compass survey can be a time consuming, dangerous, or even impossible task depending on the conditions and location of outcrops. The importance of this type of data in rock-mass classifications and structural geology has led to the development of new techniques, in which the application of photogrammetric 3D digital models has had an increasing use. In this paper we present two algorithms for extraction of attitudes of geological discontinuities from virtual outcrop models: ply2atti and scanline, implemented with the Python programming language. The ply2atti algorithm allows for the virtual sampling of planar discontinuities appearing on the 3D model as individual exposed surfaces, while the scanline algorithm allows the sampling of discontinuities (surfaces and traces) along a virtual scanline. Application to digital models of a simplified test setup and a rock cut demonstrated a good correlation between the surveys undertaken using traditional field compass reading and virtual sampling on 3D digital models.},

Application of the hypsometric integral technique helped establish a correlation between the younger basins with structures trending N–S (±30°). The N–S faults were related to a compressional stress field (SHmax) close to E–W and SHmin (stress minimum) around N–S, thereby establishing a tectonic context of structures developed in a transpressive regime.

The bivalves are associated with ichnofossils and were collected from a bed in the upper part of the formation, within a 25 cm thick interval of dark siltstones and mudstones with planar lamination, overlain by massive sandstones. The shells are articulated, with the valves either splayed open or closed. At the top of the succession, mudstone beds nearly 1.5 m above the bivalve-bearing layers yielded well-preserved Glossopteris sp. cf. G. communis leaf fossils. The closed articulated condition of some shells indicates preservation under high sedimentation rates with low residence time of bioclasts at the sediment/water interface. However, the presence of specimens with splayed shells is usually correlated to the slow decay of the shell ligament in oxygen-deficient bottom waters. The presence of complete carbonized leaves of Glossopteris associated with the bivalve-bearing levels also suggests a possibly dysoxic-anoxic bottom environment. Overall, our data suggest that the bivalves were preserved by abrupt burial, possibly by distal sediment flows into a Brenton Loch lake, and may represent autochthonous to parautochthonous fossil accumulations. The shells resemble those of anthracosiids and are herein assigned to Palaeanodonta sp. aff. P. dubia, a species also found in the Permian succession of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Our results confirm that (a) the true distributions in space and time of all Permian non-marine (freshwater) bivalves are not yet well known, and (b) there is no evidence for marine conditions in the upper part of the Brenton Loch Formation.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we analyze how variation in cell size influences the volume calculated from digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey in two coastal Late Holocene dune fields in southern Brazil. Cell size varied from 1 to 100m. RMSE (root mean square error) of the resampled DTMs from the original LiDAR (with 0.5m resolution) increases linearly with cell size, while R2 (coefficient of determination) decreases following a second-order trend. The volume does not show simple linear or exponential behavior, but fluctuates with positive and negative deviations from the original DTM. This can be explained by a random factor in the position of the cell with regard to landforms and a relationship between cell and landform size, wherein a small change in cell size can lead to an under- or overestimation of volume. The ASTER GDEM (global digital elevation model) and X-SAR SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 1″ digital elevation models (DEMs) were not considered viable volume sources due to large deviations from the reference data, either as a consequence of noise in the SRTM X-SAR data or lack of bias elevation correction to a common reference base in the GDEM processing chain. Volumes from a 3-arcsec SIR-C SRTM deviated around ±5% from the reference data and are considered suitable input for numerical simulations of Quaternary dune field evolution models because these values should be within the expected range of sediment volume changes over hundreds to millions of years.},

  abstract  = {Base-level maps (or "isobase maps", as originally defined by Filosofov, 1960), express a relationship between valley order and topography. The base-level map can be seen as a "simplified" version of the original topographic surface, from which the "noise" of the low-order stream erosion was removed. This method is able to identify areas with possible tectonic influence even within lithologically uniform domains. Base-level maps have been recently applied in semi-detail scale (e.g., 1:50 000 or larger) morphotectonic analysis. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the method's applicability in regional-scale analysis (e.g., 1:250 000 or smaller). A test area was selected in northern Brazil, at the lower course of the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers. The drainage network extracted from SRTM30_PLUS DEMs with spatial resolution of approximately 900 m was visually compared with available topographic maps and considered to be compatible with a 1:1,000 000 scale. Regarding the interpretation of regional-scale morphostructures, the map constructed with 2nd and 3rd-order valleys was considered to present the best results. Some of the interpreted base-level anomalies correspond to important shear zones and geological contacts present in the 1:5 000 000 Geological Map of South America. Others have no correspondence with mapped Precambrian structures and are considered to represent younger, probably neotectonic, features. A strong E-W orientation of the base-level lines over the inflexion of the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers, suggest a major drainage capture. A N-S topographic swath profile over the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers reveals a topographic pattern which, allied with seismic data showing a roughly N-S direction of extension in the area, lead us to interpret this lineament as an E-W, southward-dipping normal fault. There is also a good visual correspondence between the base-level lineaments and geophysical anomalies. A NW-SE lineament in the southeast of the study area partially corresponds to the northern border of the Mosquito lava field, of Jurassic age, and a NW-SE lineament traced in the northeastern sector of the study area can be interpreted as the Picos-Santa Inês lineament, identifiable in geophysical maps but with little expression in hypsometric or topographic maps.},

  abstract  = {The Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) Itapucumí Group in northern Paraguay is composed of carbonate and siliciclastic rocks, including ooid grainstones, marls, shales and sandstones, containing Cloudina fossils in the eastern region. It is almost undeformed over the Rio Apa Cratonic Block but shows a strong deformational pattern at its western edge. A detailed structural analysis of the Itapucumí Group was conducted in the Vallemí Mine, along with a regional survey in other outcrops downstream in the Paraguay River and in the San Alfredo, Cerro Paiva and Sargento José E. López regions. In the main Vallemí quarry, the structural style is characterized by an axial-plane slaty cleavage in open to isoclinal folds, sometimes overturned, associated with N–S trending thrust faults and shear zones of E-vergence and with a low-grade chlorite zone metamorphism. The structural data presented here are compatible with the hypothesis of a newly recognized mobile belt on the western side of the Rio Apa Cratonic Block, with opposite vergence to that of the Paraguay Mobile Belt in Brazil. Both belts are related to the Late Brasiliano/Pan-African tectonic cycle with a Lower Cambrian deformation and metamorphism age. The deformation could be due to the late collision of the Amazonian Craton with the remainder of Western Gondwana or to the western active plate boundary related to the Pampean Belt. The structural and lithologic differences between the western Itapucumí Group in the Vallemí and Paraguay River region and the eastern region, near San Alfredo and Cerro Paiva, suggest that this group could be divided into two lithostratigraphic units, but more stratigraphic and geochronological analyses are required to confirm this possibility.},

  abstract    = {Surface roughness is an important geomorphological variable which has been used in the Earth and planetary sciences to infer material properties, current/past processes, and the time elapsed since formation. No single definition exists; however, within the context of geomorphometry, we use surface roughness as an expression of the variability of a topographic surface at a given scale, where the scale of analysis is determined by the size of the landforms or geomorphic features of interest. Six techniques for the calculation of surface roughness were selected for an assessment of the parameter's behavior at different spatial scales and data-set resolutions. Area ratio operated independently of scale, providing consistent results across spatial resolutions. Vector dispersion produced results with increasing roughness and homogenization of terrain at coarser resolutions and larger window sizes. Standard deviation of residual topography highlighted local features and did not detect regional relief. Standard deviation of elevation correctly identified breaks of slope and was good at detecting regional relief. Standard deviation of slope (SDslope) also correctly identified smooth sloping areas and breaks of slope, providing the best results for geomorphological analysis. Standard deviation of profile curvature identified the breaks of slope, although not as strongly as SDslope, and it is sensitive to noise and spurious data. In general, SDslope offered good performance at a variety of scales, while the simplicity of calculation is perhaps its single greatest benefit.},

Os resultados obtidos nas diferentes técnicas utilizadas apresentam elipsoides com geometria e parâmetros de forma semelhantes entre si, mas com grau de anisotropias diferentes. As orientações dos eixos dos elipsoides obtidos são condizentes com as estruturas geológicas observadas em campo, como a foliação principal e a lineação mineral. Entre as características observadas nos elipsoides de deformação obtidos nesse trabalho, destacam-se a forte orientação do eixo C (associado ao polo da foliação) e o predomínio de elipsoides associados a tramas planares e plano-lineares (predomínio de achatamento na deformação). A deformação observada nos Metagranitoides Cariris Velhos é associada ao desenvolvimento das zonas de cisalhamento brasilianas regionais desenvolvidas sob esforços transpressivos.},

  abstract  = {A first assessment of the TanDEM-X DEMs over Brazilian territory is presented through a comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 DEMs in seven study areas with distinct geomorphological contexts, vegetation coverage, and land use. Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12 m data to a 30 m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30 m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.},

  abstract  = {In the Amazonian lowlands, the shift from a large wetland dominated by flooded forests (Várzea) to the modern incised valleys bounded by extensive areas of non-flooded forests (Terra Firme) is considered a key driver of the Amazonian mega-biodiversity. Dating the sedimentary beds covered by Terra Firme forest is crucial to constrain the timing of such landscape change. Here we determined the formation ages of widespread regions of Terra Firme substrates in central Amazonian lowlands combining optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, magnetostratigraphy and palinostratigraphy. Our data suggest a very dynamic fluvial system leading to a recent expansion of Terra Firme forests and retraction of Várzea forests during the late Pleistocene. The shift from an extensively flooded to non-flooded surface resulted from river incision around 45-35 ka, which potentially influenced the distribution of taxa by expanding available habitat, creating new barriers to dispersal, or changing the permeability of previous barriers. Transitions between flooded and non-flooded landscapes may have driven diversification and caused changes to species distributions, contributing to the high species diversity and biogeographic patterns currently found in the region. The late Quaternary evolution of Terra Firme substrates reveals that physical landscape changes play a major role in shaping biotic habitats even in the 104–105 years time-scales.},

  abstract  = {The origin of modern disjunct plant distributions in the Brazilian Highlands with strong floristic affinities to distant montane rainforests of isolated mountaintops in the northeast and northern Amazonia and the Guyana Shield remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that these unexplained biogeographical patterns reflect former ecosystem rearrangements sustained by widespread plant migrations possibly due to climatic patterns that are very dissimilar from present-day conditions. To address this issue, we mapped the presence of the montane arboreal taxa Araucaria, Podocarpus, Drimys, Hedyosmum, Ilex, Myrsine, Symplocos, and Weinmannia, and cool-adapted plants in the families Myrtaceae, Ericaceae, and Arecaceae (palms) in 29 palynological records during Heinrich Stadial 1 Event, encompassing a latitudinal range of 30°S to 0°S. In addition, Principal Component Analysis and Species Distribution Modelling were used to represent past and modern habitat suitability for Podocarpus and Araucaria. The data reveals two long-distance patterns of plant migration connecting south/southeast to northeastern Brazil and Amazonia with a third short route extending from one of them. Their paleofloristic compositions suggest a climatic scenario of abundant rainfall and relative lower continental surface temperatures, possibly intensified by the effects of polar air incursions forming cold fronts into the Brazilian Highlands. Although these taxa are sensitive to changes in temperature, the combined pollen and speleothems proxy data indicate that this montane rainforest expansion during Heinrich Stadial 1 Event was triggered mainly by a less seasonal rainfall regime from the subtropics to the equatorial region.},

  abstract   = {This work presents a 1:10,000 geomorphological mapping of an area in southeastern Brazil, based on morphometric analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), while classical methods focus on photo interpretation. Data derived from the DEM include elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, vertical and horizontal curvatures, amplitude, elongation and wavelength of landforms. These parameters were used along with slope shape and drainage patterns to classify the landforms according to the Land Systems method, in which portions of the landscape that presents similar terrains attributes are grouped from regional (low detail) to local (high detail) scales, respectively, Land Systems, Land Units and Land Elements. The São Paulo State geomorphological map at 1:1,000,000 scale is considered the best reference source, and was compared with the results obtained in this project. Two Land Systems, four Land Units and twelve Land Elements were identified in the study area. In this area, karst terrains are common and easily identified due their characteristics drainage patterns, amplitude and slope gradient. Karst terrain boundaries defined in this study do overlap with those defined in the state map, however the morphometric analysis allowed a better description of the terrain attributes used to define them. The terrain attributes derived automatically from the DEM enabled an accurate geomorphological classification of the study area. The methodology presented in this paper is considered effective for mapping landforms at a detailed scale and can be employed in regional scale mapping using coarser resolution DEMs.},

Companies and countries that depend on these sources of energy (so-called not clean) take actions to search for palliative solutions. The production of atlases of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the collaborative actions that seeks to systematize and organize several aspects involving the use of CCS technologies. This paper focuses on an analytical overview of approaches addressed by five different CCS atlases published by Brazil, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Norway, and South Africa. The five atlases are available for public access; an analytical overview could substantiate the academic and technical decisions related to the future publication of a new atlas for any country and suggests the inclusion of new topics such as social and environmental issues.},

  abstract  = {We present a new 52 m composite record (COL17c) composed of five sedimentary sequences retrieved from the Colônia basin (Southeastern Brazil). The COL17c record is composed of two main sub-units deposited under different regimes: a peatland above ~14 m and lacustrine sediments below. Sedimentary description and core scanning (MSCL and XRF) are first used to align individual cores in order to produce a nearly continuous composite record. We then established an original chronological framework based on radiocarbon, paleomagnetic, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence at elevated temperature (pIRIR290°C) and authigenic 10Be/9Be dating. We describe the protocols used for each technique and discuss the positive and negative results, as well as their implications for proxy interpretation. In spite of negative results of some techniques, mainly due to the absence of adequate sample material, the multi-proxy approach used is essential to maximize the chances of obtaining a satisfactory age model for this unique continental sedimentary sequence. All valid chronological proxies, comprising three AMS 14C ages, one pIRIR290°C age, two paleomagnetic constraints and eight authigenic 10Be/9Be datum, are integrated within a Bayesian age-depth modeling to produce a 1.5 ± 0.1 Ma chronology for the whole COL17c sequence. This age model represents the first long-term chronological estimate of sediments deposition in the Colônia basin. The record allows to refine the age of the Colônia basin formation between 5.3 and 11.2 Ma, much older than previously estimated from short sedimentary cores.},

  abstract  = {Sand dunes are commonly regarded as a challenge to traditional photogrammetry due their homogeneous texture and spectral response. In this work we present an evaluation of Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to obtain high-resolution elevation data of coastal sand dunes based on images acquired by Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of a dunefield in Southern Brazil was generated from 810 photos captured by an RPA at 100 m above the takeoff point in February 2019. Image matching was successful in all areas of the survey due the presence of superficial features (footprints and sandboard tracks) and visibility of the sedimentary stratification, highlighted by heavy minerals. Altimetric accuracy of the SfM-MVS DEM was validated by comparison with Terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) data collected during the same fieldwork campaign of the RPA flights. The SfM-MVS DEM was then compared to an Airborne LiDAR (ALS) DEM from October 2010. While the SfM-MVS and TLS DEMs are very similar, without any major difference in elevation or in the reconstruction of topographic features, the SfM-MVS DEM presents a small scale surface roughness not visible in the TLS DEM. The Feature Preserving DEM Smoothing (FPD) algorithm was applied to the SfM-MVS DEM with good results in terms of surface smoothing, but without any significant changes in descriptive statistics and error metrics, with an RMSE of 0.08 m and MAE of 0.06 m for both the original and the FPD-filtered DEM. Displacement of dune crest lines from the ALS and SfM-MVS DEMs resulted in a migration rate of ≈5 m/year between 2010 and 2019, in good agreement with rates derived from satellite images and historical aerial photographs of the same area. Sand volume change in the same period showed a decrease of only 0.2%, which can be related to the installation of sand fences to promote dune stabilization and sand removal from the front of the dune field to keep a road open to vehicles. ALS can cover large areas in little time but its high cost still remains a barrier to wider usage, especially by researchers in developing countries. TLS has an intermediate cost but demands more fieldwork and more processing time. In our case we needed three days for the TLS survey and around three weeks to produce a DEM of ≈80 400m2. On the other hand, we were able to cover ≈740 900m2 with six flight missions in under three hours, with ≈13 h processing time in a medium-range workstation. This makes SfM-MVS a low-cost solution with fast and reliable results for 3D modelling and continuous monitoring of coastal dunes.},

The variation of microplastics concentrations within the studied area can be related to hydraulic characteristics defining the erosive-depositional behavior of the sampling sites and their proximity to Manaus. Our results represent the first report to show the ubiquitous presence and widespread distribution of microplastics in sediments from the lower Solimões, lower Negro and upper Amazon rivers.

  abstract  = {Throughout the world, restoration of degraded areas (RDA) is not only a global but also a local challenge. In this context, the Brazilian government committed itself to restore 12 million hectares of forests by 2030. RDA monitoring customarily depends on extensive fieldwork to collect data on all individuals planted. As remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) can reduce costs and time of fieldwork activities, studying this technology is therefore timely given. A crucial metric for RDA is the number of trees established in the area. Methods using RPAs on automatic tree counting showed good accuracy using algorithms based on the canopy height model (CHM), which is the difference between a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM). However, obtaining a DTM demands an extra computational processing step and may require field control points or manually delimiting objects on the surface. The study presented here proposes and evaluates a semi-automated methodology for counting trees directly on DSM in RDAs in the Amazon using RPA coupled with a red–green–blue standard photographic sensor. The DSM method obtained good overall accuracy and F-score indexes, superior to the CHM method for all study areas even when overall accuracy was low for both methods.},

  abstract  = {Plastic found in the coastal zone is a result of waste mismanagement. This material comes directly from offshore disposal or by fishing debris, other marine activities, and by marine currents and winds, as well as urban drainage systems and estuaries. Specifically, in the case of plastic pellets, which are spheres with 2-5 mm that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of plastic products, the Santos Port and the plastic factories in Cubatão city (Brazilian southeastern coast), are considered the main local sources for the São Paulo state coast. Consequently, the beaches most affected by this pollutant are those near Santos estuary, like Enseada do Guarujá beach. However, some questions are still open, such as: what are the mechanisms which control the pellets deposition, and which locations are most favorable for deposition on the beach? To answer these questions, a four-step research was carried out at Enseada beach: 1) Plastic pellets geodetic survey based on GNSS positioning; 2) Beach geomorphometric parameters (altitude, aspect, and slope) derived by Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 3) Strandline altitude estimated through wave climate and tide height; and, 4) Plastic pellets deposition Suitability Index (PSI). The joint analysis of the altimetric, geomorphometric and meteoceanographic aspects showed that the beach areas with altitudes higher than those calculated for the strandline (> 2.06 m), slope ∼ 3º and facing the same direction of the higher energy waves (157.5-202.5º) were more susceptible to pellet deposition. This indicates that the accumulation of this pollutant on the beach is controlled not only by its physical characteristics, but mainly by storm surge events. Besides, surveys with geodetic reference (fixed, univocal, and relatively stable on time) bring up altimetric information as a result of all interactions and can be compared with other beaches anywhere on the planet — thus contributing to a standardization of the survey methodology.},
